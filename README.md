# SlideShow using jquery, ajax.

*This is my first upload*

## Instructions
>Click on either the right or left arrow to view an image with its caption and description.

### Requirements
1. Arrow buttons to navigate between images
2. An auto-rotate feature that navigates through the images on a loop
2. A caption for each image
3. A fade in and fade out animation
4. A consistent height and width, regardless of the size or dimensions of the images being shown.

### Bonus
1. Use JQuery AJAX to get your images from an external API. Try NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API or find your own.
2. Allow the user to change the animation from fade in/out to slide in/out.
3. Have captions only appear on hover.
